# hello_world
A get_into repository for learning the principles of github and getting acquainted with its multiple functions
I am a masters student pursuing a degree in materials science department. 
Being very enthusiastic about learning, I wanted to explore new fields and also gain work-level knowledge in the ultimately rising field of programming.
I choose to learn python to be the ground on which, I would go on and learn about more interesting topics like Artificial Intelligence.
I think that learning python will give me an upper hand when I try to apply for a job compared with other materials science applicants who don't know how to write codes to ease their data analysis.
